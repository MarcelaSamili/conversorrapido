## About The project

This project is a website that converts measurements, and also teaches you how to convert in case you need to study about it, it is simple and functional.

This was the first project I developed when I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript in 2021. Shortly after, I learned ReactJS and moved it to React. At the same time, I learned a little about SEO and applied it to it.

You can clone it and see it working on your machine. Just extract it and click on the index file that will open in your browser.

Attention! Do not publish for your own profit.
